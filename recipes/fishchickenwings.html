                <li>Scrape into a small bowl, add warm water, and let sit for a few minutes.       </li>
                <li>Pour through a fine sieve set over a bowl, and use the back of a spoon to stir and smoosh garlic against the sieve, reserving leftover garlic.                    </li>
                <li>Place chicken wings in a separate large bowl, add 1/2 cup of fish sauce mixture (reserve the rest in the refrigerator), and toss well. .</li>

                <li>Place chicken wings in a separate large bowl, add 1/2 cup of fish sauce mixture (reserve the rest in the refrigerator), and toss well. </li>
                <li>Cover and refrigerate wings for at least four hours, or overnight, tossing every hour or so. </li>

        <h3>Fry</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat 3/4-inch of vegetable oil in a small pan over high heat and add reserved garlic.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium-low, fry until garlic is lightly golden brown, about 5 minutes, and transfer to paper towels to drain (set aside until final cooking stage).</li>
                <li>Transfer wings from refrigerator to a colander in the sink and let drain for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir together rice flour and tempura mix in a large bowl and toss wings until coated well.</li>
                <li>Pour enough oil into a wok or dutch oven to completely submerge the wings, about 2 inches, and bring oil to 325 degrees (measure with a candy thermometer).</li>
                <li>Fry wings in two batches, gently knocking them against the bowl before adding to the oil.</li>

                <li>Combine 1/4 cup of the water–fish sauce mixture and half the chile paste (if you are using it), bring to a full boil in a nonstick wok, and reduce for about 45 seconds.</li>
                <li>Add half the wings and toss every 15 seconds, until a caramelized glaze coats the wings, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Add 1 tbsp of the fried garlic, toss well, and cook about 30 seconds longer.</li>
                <li>Rinse and wipe out wok, and repeat with the next batch of wings.</li>
                <li>Serve wings with pickled vegetables, cucumber spears, and herb sprigs.</li>
