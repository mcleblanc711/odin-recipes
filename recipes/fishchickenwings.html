        <li>2 envelopes Fleischmann's® RapidRise Yeast</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Spice Islands® Ground Saigon Cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 cup milk plus</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter or margarine</li>
        <li>3 egg yolks</li>
        <li>Mazola® Corn Oil for deep frying</li>
        <li>1 cup apple cider</li>
        <li>2 cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Karo® Light Corn Syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine 2 cups flour, undissolved yeast, sugar, salt and cinnamon in a large mixer bowl. 
                Heat milk and butter to very warm (120 degrees to 130 degrees F). Add to flour mixture with egg yolks; 
                beat for 2 minutes at low speed. 
                Continue adding remaining flour, until soft dough forms.
            </li>   
            <li>Knead on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic (about 4 to 6 minutes). Cover and let 
                rest for 10 minutes. Roll out dough on a lightly floured counter into a 12-inch circle, 
                about 1/2-inch thick. Using a 3-inch cookie or biscuit cutter, cut out as many rounds as possible. 
                Cut out center with a 1-inch cookie cutter or poke hole through the center with finger. Place 
                doughnuts about 2 to 3 inches apart on lightly greased or parchment lined baking sheet. Re-roll 
                and cut remaining dough. Cover doughnuts and let rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour.
                </li>
            <li>Heat at least 2 inches of oil in a deep fryer or deep pan to 350 degrees F. Fry 2 to 3 
                doughnuts at a time, turning occasionally until well browned, about 2 to 3 minutes. 
                Remove from oil and drain on paper towels. Cool a few minutes, then transfer to wire 
                rack. Drizzle with Apple Cider Glaze OR using tongs, dunk the doughnuts in the glaze. 
                Serve warm.
                </li>
            <li>For Apple Cider Glaze: Boil apple cider in a small saucepan until reduced in half, about 7 to 10 minutes.
                </li>
            <li>Place powdered sugar in medium bowl. Whisk in hot cider and corn syrup until smooth.</li>
